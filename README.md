This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Demo code for a talk I did at Benchling and Women Level Up. The demo is basically the same as [the demo shown at ReactConf](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpw9EHDh2bM).

To see the code or play around with it, clone down the repo and run `yarn && yarn start`. See tags for relevant entry points.

The slides are [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1WUSUKGd5EGjdXVJyJadvR8f-KaUpD8ydY8TzgU3kees/edit?usp=sharing).
